# Remote-App
# **Measure Visual Acuity Remote App**
## Team SecureVision 

## Requirements
The API, Remote application and display application must be connected on the same network.

## Usage
- The remote app takes in the patient's details such as their 'Name', 'Age', 'Email', 'Contact' and the IP address of the API server. 
- The volunteer selects the mode in which the app needs to run based on the surrounding light ambience and space.
- There are two modes - Periscope and Non Periscope mode.
- If non periscope mode is selected, the distance is to be provided between the display screen and the patient.
- Then the volunteer selects the appropriate chart that needs to be rendered on the display device based on literacy, age, etc.
- Finally, volunteer validates if the patient's response is correct or not. After all the readings are done, the visual acuity is displayed at the end.
- The results are stored in the MongoDB database and the same is sent to the patient via Email using SMTP Protocol.
